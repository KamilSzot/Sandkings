Toy inspired by Sandkings novelette by George R. R. Martin



No build required. Just open index.html in your browser (preferably Chrome, but should work also in Firefox and modern IE).



Work in progress. Ideas for improvements:

- adjust view on browser window resize
- introduce group behaviour (boids like)
- refine structure and encapsulation further
- extract more variables to object configs
- bring back killed enemies to spawn point
- ability to kill enemy spawn point
